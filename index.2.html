        Hello! My name is Pramish Shrestha. I am 17 years old, born on 2065-06-18. My father name is Pradip Shrestha and My mother name is Sunita Shrestha. Currently, I am studying at National School Of Sciences.

My permanent address is chitwan, sharadanagar town . My temporary address is Raniban.
<br><br>
My hobbies are a mix of creativity, physical activity, and intellectual challenges. I love playing sports because they keep me active, teach me teamwork, and help me stay disciplined. When Iâ€™m in a creative mood, I enjoy drawing, where I can express my thoughts and ideas visually. Lastly, programming is my way of solving problems and building something meaningful through code. Each hobby brings a unique balance to my life, helping me grow physically, creatively, and intellectually.
